# Terracotta VSCode Extension
Currently you have to manually download the language server from [here](https://github.com/MrAwesomeOwl/terracotta) and set the extension setting `remember to put the setting name here` to its path

Also you need to need to install [bun](https://bun.sh/) if you haven't already because their npm package is broken and i'm too lazy to either make my own installer or switch to node

**this will be streamlined when i upload it to the vscode marketplace**

Official support for other editors isn't planned but you're welcome to port this to whatever
